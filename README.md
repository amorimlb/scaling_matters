# scaling_matters
This repository is home to the code and results used in the research paper "The choice of scaling technique matters for classification performance".

- In the Code directory you can find the Jupiter Notebooks that run the experiment.
- In the Results directory I am providing a copy of my results, but you can obtain these by running the experiment.ipynb notebook.
- The Datasets directory includes the .csv files that are converted from the original KEEL .dat (also included) by the experiment.ipynb notebook.
- The Supplemental material directory holds a PDF file that contains the full list of papers and statistics about them mentioned in our papers introduction.
