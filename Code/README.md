This directory contains two Jupyter Notebooks:
- 1. experiment.ipynb
    This notebook runs all the preprocessing and then trains and evaluates the models, the results are then saved in CSV files. We are providing these results in     the Results directory.

- 2. analysis.ipynb:
    This notebook runs hypothesis tests and builds all the tables and graphs used in the paper.
    
The rest of the files and directories within this Code directory are generated when one runs the notebooks.
